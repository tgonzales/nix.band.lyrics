(SFX: relay clicks, jar seal hiss, faint calliope)

**Brain:** Staging environment ready. Feelings quarantined. No unauthorized deployments.

**Brain:** We quarantined our feelings in a glass-box lab,
Tagged the risky ones with yellow hazard tabs.
No hotfix hugs, no Friday-night release,
We ship when truth compiles and all the warnings cease.

**Human:** I brought a proof-of-concept--hand-shake, eyes-on-me;
If love can pass the smoke test, push to PROD, set free.

Run unit tests--kiss, stare, silence--go:
Kiss returned "true," the stare ran slow;
Silence hit timeout at 0:33--okay,
Patch the courage, try again my way.

**Chorus:**
Sandbox love--if it survives, we'll ship at zero-one-thirteen,
Deploy or rollback? Choose red or green.
I'll stage your touch until the world agrees,
Sandbox love--promote to PROD or let it freeze.

Sandbox love--release the build, or hold the line--
If kindness passes health checks, press "go" this time.

**Human:** We feature-flagged our promise, kept the danger dim,
Did A/B with the sunrise--control vs. a whim.
**Brain:** Canary hearts are fragile, still they hum along,
If Variant B is honest, it can join the song.

**Human:** Clear the staging logs, I'll pay the testing debt;
**Brain:** Flush the cache of grudges--then we won't forget.

Schema-migrate trust from v0 to v1,
Back up every "always," keep the brittle "someday" gone.
Ping my hope at intervals, keep-alive the thread--
And if doubt goes 500, we'll reboot instead.

**Chorus:**
Sandbox love--if it survives, we'll ship at zero-one-thirteen,
Deploy or rollback? Choose red or green.
I'll stage your touch until the world agrees,
Sandbox love--promote to PROD or let it freeze.

Sandbox love--release the build, or hold the line--
If kindness passes health checks, press "go" this time.

(instrumental: slide guitar "bubble" bends; muted-brass stamps; calliope echoes; gear-click groove)

**Chorus (final):**
Sandbox love--if it survives, we'll ship at zero-one-thirteen,
Deploy or rollback? Choose red or green.
I'll stage your touch until the world agrees,
Sandbox love--promote to PROD or let it freeze.

Sandbox love--merge the branch and sign the note:
"Shipped with care"--now let the chorus float.

(SFX: valve exhale, single "deploy successful" chime)
**Brain:** Promotion complete. Monitoring feelings... all systems warm.
