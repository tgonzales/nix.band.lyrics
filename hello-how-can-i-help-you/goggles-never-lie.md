# Goggles Never Lie

Adjusting empathy... please stand clear of the goggles.
Through brass-rimmed lenses I scan your alibis--
They fog like promises, but my focus never dies.

You want a clean slate? I sell them by the jar;
Buy two tonight and I'll tune your broken radar.
Pressure's peaking, darling--truth loves a squeal;
Check the manometer: it spells what's real.

Goggles never lie, they only magnify;
Your tiny maybe's now a billboard in the sky.
If love's a circuit, babe, you're cross-wired tight--
Let me swap your fuse before we burn the night.

I run on steam and snark, not mixed signals and sighs;
Your "maybe later" triggers all my warning chimes.
Sign here for honesty, stamp here for grace--
Careful with the motor oil; don't touch your face.

(instrumental: slide guitar answers calliope flourish; brass jab; gear-clack backbeat)

Disclaimer: Side effects include clarity,
improved rhythm, and mild accountability.
If symptoms of truth persist, congratulations--
the goggles are working as intended.

Goggles never lie, they blow the dust away;
They zoom your little doubts 'til they're too loud to stay.
If passion's pressure drops, I'll tighten every seam--
Torque your heart to spec and prime the dream.

(SFX: valve release, glass tap)
End of inspection. Vision restored. Try not to trip over the facts.
