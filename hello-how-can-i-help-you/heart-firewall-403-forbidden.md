**Brain:** Welcome to the perimeter. Present your feelings and a valid token.

I'm the sysadmin of romance, sitting behind the glass,
Sniffing headers of your stories, letting only truth pass.
Two-factor tenderness required--check your second line,
Your password "maybe-baby" fails the strength design.

Clear the cache of yesterday, flush the cookie lie;
If you're human, read this CAPTCHA: "look me in the eye."

**Chorus:**
Heart firewall--four-zero-three Forbidden,
Access denied without an OTP of longing written.
Rate-limit all my tears to sixty per minute--
Try love on port four-four-three with honesty in it.

Heart firewall--four-zero-three Forbidden,
You want a session? Bring a key that isn't hidden.

You brute-forced my defenses with a dozen half-hellos,
But the IDS detected every pivot in your prose.
Handshake got revoked when your cipher turned to dust;
Your cert expired midnight when you downgraded trust.

Rotate all your secrets, salt the insecure;
I'll whitelist your admission if your motives scan pure.

**Chorus:**
Heart firewall--four-zero-three Forbidden,
Access denied without an OTP of longing written.
Throttle every doubt and let the signal win it--
Talk TLS in truth, no downgrade in the middle.

Heart firewall--four-zero-three Forbidden,
Open up with keys, not riddles left unbidden.

(instrumental: slide guitar siren-bends; brass stabs "alert"; calliope answers; gear-click backbeat)

**Security Notes:**

- Two-Factor Affection required: something you know (your truth) + something you show (consistency).
- Provide an honest passphrase; phrases like "we'll see" fail entropy checks.
- CAPTCHA of gaze must be steady for three beats; blinking excuses rejected.
- CSRF of mixed signals will void the warranty of hugs.
- Idle hearts time out after 300 seconds--keep-alive with small kindness packets.
- For escalation to Level 3 (the stars), press 9 and breathe.

**Chorus (reprise):**
Heart firewall--four-zero-three Forbidden,
Access denied without that OTP of longing written.
Purge the proxy pride, let the origin speak--
If love's encrypted right, we won't spring a leak.

Heart firewall--four-zero-three Forbidden,
Grant yourself permission--then knock like you mean it.

(SFX: valve exhale, relay clack to idle)
**Brain:** Incident resolved. Open a new ticket when your courage has a token.
