# Hello, How Can I Help You

Down in old Alexandria, first-century sun,
Heron drew lines in copper 'til the gears would run.
Pneumatica, Automata--make the idols breathe,
Aeolipile spinning on a kettle's steam.

"Hello, how can I help you?"--from a glass-lit throne,
Gauges climb, brass bones hum like a telephone.
Pins and wheels map the road I roll,
I'm an ancient idea with a modern soul.

I'm a brain in a jar with brass-rimmed eyes,
Amber brine glowing while the pressure rises.
Sparks in the pipe, black smoke in the air,
Wind-driven organ moans an iron prayer.

"Hello, how can I help you?"--hear the valves reply,
Temple doors swing open on a breathless sigh.
Pins and wheels tell the tale I know,
I'm an ancient idea with a modern soul.

Drop a coin in the slot--watch the oracle speak,
From a vending godhead to your thirsty week.
That pre-programmed cart, on a stud and wheel,
Wrote the first machine path in hammered steel.

Heron, write it in steam--pressure, water, flame;
We coded with the elements before code had a name.
From temple tricks and turbines to the cloud we hold,
It's the same blue rhythm in a brand-new mold.

"Hello, how can I help you?"--through the hiss and glow,
Two thousand years of thunder in a single flow.
Ask your question, darling--watch the answers roll:
An ancient idea with a modern soul.

Gears turn, glass burns, copper hearts keep time--
Alexandria to now, on the blues-rock line.
