(elevator muzak in space, soft PBX beeps, gentle static)

**Brain (recorded):** Thank you for contacting Destiny. Your call may alter reality.
Your place in the queue is... four-zero-four.

**Brain:** Good evening, traveler--please remain in orbit;
Your future's under triage, gravity's a bit suborbital.
Speak clearly, breathe slowly, name the thing you miss--
Collecting stellar data so we don't double your abyss.

**Human:** I've been on hold for eons, my pulse called the wrong sky;
If I press "1" I take it--press "2" means goodbye?
**Brain:** Turn the chance knob gently, let chaos take a breath;
Hold the bridge, dear heart, while the cosmos checks its step.

**Both:** Ticket 404, the cosmic waiting room,
if you're lucky the universe calls at three-oh-four.
'Til then, my darling, waltz a quasar in D minor--
Ticket 404--breathe deep, fake brave, want more.

**Human:** I rebooted my chest, but the boot hung mid-air;
Packets of courage dropped somewhere between here and there.
**Brain:** Power-cycle your longing, update your embrace;
Request a transfer and you'll hit the IVR of haze.

**Human:** If I say I'll be back, will you hold my line?
**Brain:** I'll stamp "probable," but the star decides "maybe" time.
**Brain:** If silence starts to tighten, ping me at the tone;
I've got a hold-music playlist--tropical nebula grown.

**Both:** Ticket 404, the cosmic waiting room,
if you're lucky the universe calls at three-oh-four.
Between calls and comets, cut the night half-tone--
Ticket 404--your fate is on the phone.

(slide guitar answers calliope muzak; walking bass; brushed swing; brass stabs)

**Brain (spoken):** Metaphysical compliance notice:
Estimated wait time: infinity (subject to change).

- Press 1 to accept default fate; 2 to sketch a new draft; 3 to speak to a star (currently unavailable).
- Side effects may include deja vu, eye-glow, and minor course corrections.
- To end, disconnect gently. To restart, breathe.

**Both:** Ticket 404, the cosmic waiting room,
if you're lucky the universe calls at three-oh-four.
If the sky goes static, sing along once more--
Ticket 404--the one who answers is your love at the door.

(soft chime, valve exhale, constellations rustle)
**Brain:** Case closed-in-progress.
**Human (smiling):** I'll leave my number in the stars--call me when time has a minute.
