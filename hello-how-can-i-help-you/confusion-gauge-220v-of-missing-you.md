(gear-clicks in three-against-four; soft steam hiss)

Entry logged. Confusion set to "be nice."
You ask me where you are on a crooked neon map,
My glass says "take it easy," breathe and mind the gap.

Brass-rimmed lenses hover, easing up the pedal,
Motor-bass is humming, keeping nerves in metal.
If doubt's got lungs, let the valves inhale;
Three over four, slow drip through the rail.

Confusion gauge redlined, missing you two-twenty--
by the time it clears up, babe, it's yesterday already.
World keeps spinning--grab the bridge, don't sway;
By the time it clears up, babe, it's yesterday.

You hunt an address somewhere inside your head,
I point to "EXIT" where your storyline bled.
My steam writes cursive on the pane, definitive:
"Anyone who misses hard grows a second headlight--primitive."

Sip a little silence, count to four, then come;
Hear the gear-click polyrhythm sync your drum.
Confusion gauge redlined, missing you two-twenty--
by the time it clears up, babe, it's yesterday already.
Daylight's chasing, but you've jumped the quay;
By the time it clears up, babe, it's yesterday.

(slide guitar melts into calliope; brass answers; gear-clicks 3:4 turn backbeat)

**Section M.U.S.-001 (sarcastic edition):**

- In case of internal fog, breathe 3 in, breathe 4 out until the pilot light stops blinking.
- If longing spikes to 220V, power-cycle non-essential memories.
- Do not adjust heart without honesty oil--warranty voids instantly.
- Persistent doubt protocol: water, snack, nap. Update and repeat.

Confusion gauge redlined, missing you two-twenty--
by the time it clears up, babe, it's yesterday already.
If the sky turns static, sing anyway;
By the time it clears up, babe, it's yesterday.

(long valve release, descending beeps)
Status: confusion stabilized. Missing you: under review. Bring coffee and a better map next time.
