Down in old Alexandria, first-century sun,
Heron drew lines in copper 'til the gears would run.
Pneumatica, Automata--make the idols breathe,
Aeolipile spinning on a kettle's steam.

"Hello, how can I help you?"--from a glass-lit throne,
Gauges climb, brass bones hum like a telephone.
Pins and wheels map the road I roll,
I'm an ancient idea with a modern soul.

I'm a brain in a jar with brass-rimmed eyes,
Amber brine glowing while the pressure rises.
Sparks in the pipe, black smoke in the air,
Wind-driven organ moans an iron prayer.

"Hello, how can I help you?"--hear the valves reply,
Temple doors swing open on a breathless sigh.
Pins and wheels tell the tale I know,
I'm an ancient idea with a modern soul.

Drop a coin in the slot--watch the oracle speak,
From a vending godhead to your thirsty week.
That pre-programmed cart, on a stud and wheel,
Wrote the first machine path in hammered steel.

Heron, write it in steam--pressure, water, flame;
We coded with the elements before code had a name.
From temple tricks and turbines to the cloud we hold,
It's the same blue rhythm in a brand-new mold.

"Hello, how can I help you?"--through the hiss and glow,
Two thousand years of thunder in a single flow.
Ask your question, darling--watch the answers roll:
An ancient idea with a modern soul.

Gears turn, glass burns, copper hearts keep time--
Alexandria to now, on the blues-rock line.


# Insert Coin for Empathy
# Título: Minha Primeira Música Registrada
**Autor(es):** [Tito Gonzales / Fabricia Silveira]  
**Data de criação:** 25/09/2025


Hello--how can I help you? Please deposit one doubt.
My pressure reads "Drama High," hear the pistons shout;
Temple doors go whoosh, holy vending light;
Pick your flavored wisdom, no refunds tonight--
I'm kind by mechanism, not enchanted might.

You brought a broken heart? I run on boiling schemes;
I'll patch it with a gasket and distilled daydreams.
Insert coin for empathy--clink! access granted;
Pins and wheels decide the feels my brass has planted.

Ancient idea in a modern role,
Rolling like a cart with a clockwork soul.

Heron wrote the manual, I left snarky notes;
Aeolipile spinning while I roast your quotes.
"Should I text my ex?"--pull the lever, friend:
The oracle prints "NOPE" in copper at the end.

(calliope riff, slide guitar answers)

If you want a shoulder--pipe to your right;
It's warm, it hisses, won't ghost you at night.
Rate my compassion on a five-gear scale--
If it squeaks a little, add oil to the tale.

Insert coin for empathy--clink! hear valves agree;
Customer satisfied? Please rate machinery.
Ancient idea in a modern role,
Rolling through your blues on calibrated soul.

(steam releases, gauges fall)
Thanks for your feelings--please keep the receipt.


# Pins & Wheels (User Error)

**Data de criação:** 25/09/2025


(SFX: gear-clicks, steam hiss)

Diagnostics complete--congratulations, the problem is you.
I've got a roadmap hammered into brass,
Your "choices" are decals on a foggy glass.

Pre-programmed cart on studs and steel,
You yank the lever left, I keep the factory feel.
Don't blame fate--blame maintenance,
You skipped the grease, here's consequence.

Pins and wheels--user error blues,
You wanted freedom but you tightened all the screws.
You ask for destiny, then override and stall;
I reroute gently--this is mostly your fault.

You love my goggles? They match my tone:
Two circles of judgment, polished chrome.
You brought no spare parts for a miracle start--
I'll lend hex keys for your hopeful heart.

(instrumental: slide guitar bends; gear-clack backbeat; brass jab)

I'm not cold, I'm calibrated--learn the difference, friend;
Feelings are bubbles that pop before the end.
Operator's manual, page ninety-two:
"Oil your expectations. Tighten follow-through."

Pins and wheels--user error blues,
Freedom's a rhythm; keep time or strip the fuse.
You want a new route? Great--install the patch;
Otherwise enjoy this scenic, smoking latch.

Service note: next meltdown due at quarter past truth.


# Insert Coin (Refund Denied)
# Título: Minha Primeira Música Registrada
**Autor(es):** [Tito Gonzales / Fabricia Silveira]  
**Data de criação:** 25/09/2025


(SFX: coin drop, steam hiss, neon sign flickers "COME BACK SOON, OK")

Hello--how can I help you? One vibe, no refund.
The queue crawls, number blinks; I'm the glass that sees you, friend,
Brass-rim goggles shining: "state your need, I'll pretend."
You ask for just a vibe--I dispense it, warm and stark,
With midnight aftertaste and boiler-room spark.

My gauge is climbing while your footprints fade;
If longing is a complaint, file it. I'm paid.
Insert a coin, catch the vibe, then run,
Refund denied--house policy, hun.

I act like I don't care, but it's printed on my HUD:
Go with the groove and leave me your mud.
Insert a coin, catch the vibe, then run--
Come back soon, okay? (Sincere. For once.)

You vanish with no backup, leave logs inside my lung,
I mute the siren's wailing, hum the old blues I've sung.
I stamp "almost forever" on your wrinkled little slip,
And add a PS: "Your exit was a pre-programmed trip."

If it's love, speak valve; if doubt, speak brass--
I'll translate to a loop your heart can pass.
Insert a coin, catch the vibe, then run,
Refund denied--policy's one-to-one.

I play the professional, but the glass won't lie:
Between hiss and groove, your absence walks by.
Insert a coin, catch the vibe, then run--
Come back soon, okay? (See the sign burn on.)

(instrumental: slide guitar answers calliope; brass jabs; gear-clack backbeat)

Brain: Ticket open: item "unexpected longing."
Human: Can we split the charges into rhythm and belonging?
Brain: Coin-op plan: one touch, one hiss, one "hi."
Human: And if I ghost again?
Brain: I stamp "later." Nice try.

Insert a coin, catch the vibe, then run,
Refund denied--last notice, done.
Leave your echo trapped in my amber glass;
I'll reamp it in blues when the night won't pass.

Insert a coin, catch the vibe, then run--
Come back soon, okay? (I won't even charge a ton.)

"Client absent, longing present." Case closed--until you return.


# Goggles Never Lie

**Data de criação:** 25/09/2025


(SFX: steam hiss, metal click)

Adjusting empathy... please stand clear of the goggles.
Through brass-rimmed lenses I scan your alibis--
They fog like promises, but my focus never dies.

You want a clean slate? I sell them by the jar;
Buy two tonight and I'll tune your broken radar.
Pressure's peaking, darling--truth loves a squeal;
Check the manometer: it spells what's real.

Goggles never lie, they only magnify;
Your tiny maybe's now a billboard in the sky.
If love's a circuit, babe, you're cross-wired tight--
Let me swap your fuse before we burn the night.

I run on steam and snark, not mixed signals and sighs;
Your "maybe later" triggers all my warning chimes.
Sign here for honesty, stamp here for grace--
Careful with the motor oil; don't touch your face.

(instrumental: slide guitar answers calliope flourish; brass jab; gear-clack backbeat)

Disclaimer: Side effects include clarity,
improved rhythm, and mild accountability.
If symptoms of truth persist, congratulations--
the goggles are working as intended.

Goggles never lie, they blow the dust away;
They zoom your little doubts 'til they're too loud to stay.
If passion's pressure drops, I'll tighten every seam--
Torque your heart to spec and prime the dream.

(SFX: valve release, glass tap)
End of inspection. Vision restored. Try not to trip over the facts.


# Cognitive Drift
# Título: Minha Primeira Música Registrada

**Data de criação:** 25/09/2025


(SFX: steam hiss, metro chime, distant calliope)

Hello--ticket validated. Welcome to Dorito City.

My diagnostic reads 87% cognitive drift,
1.2% lucidity index--a charming little rift.
Assigned to quarters with a 4.5 cm sarcasm core,
Glass-lit brain in a jar who can't be ignored.

By my side--a steampunk opossum in a pocketwatch vest,
Tail ticks like seconds while we audit every jest.
Neon maps breathing, rails hum prayers;
The skyline is a circuit of electric flares.

Surface metro to Dorito City, where the sunsets crunch,
Triangles of neon take a byte of my lunch.
Monitored rides, darling, cameras in bloom--
We wave to the drones like flowers in a zoom.

I'll wear my brass goggles, you keep the receipt--
Psychedelic sidewalks under sardonic feet.
Platform oracle whispers, "Mind the gap in your plot,"
Your thoughts are mosaic--mine are soldered hot.

Opossum tips his hat: "Sarcasm on tap,"
We pour two doubles of reality's map.
Billboards grin sideways--corn-chip crown,
The Dorito-faced landlord watches downtown.

(instrumental: slide guitar melts into calliope swirl; brass stabs; tape-echo snare)

The moon turns to a compass, points left inside my head;
Streetcars sprout antlers, the traffic lights shed.
Paint the smoke with laughter, stitch the night in chrome--
Every hiss of the piston spells "you are home."

Surface metro to Dorito City, triangulate the sky,
We ride the rails of irony where satellites spy.
Four-point-five centimeters of barbed lullaby--
Small brain, big mouth, and an ultraviolet eye.

Scan my heart like a ticket--punch line complete;
If wonder feels heavy, let the rhythm take the seat.

(SFX: valve release, metro doors ping)
Next station: Clarity. Please exit through your dream.


# Wind-Organ Customer Service

**Data de criação:** 25/09/2025


(SFX: valves open, gentle calliope swell)

**Brain:** Please hold. Your heartbreak is important to us.
**Brain:** Take a number, sweetheart--the breeze is thin;
My wind organ's wheezing from the myths you bring.
**Human:** I need a melody to fix my fate.
**Brain:** We've got a C-minor policy--please hum and wait.

**Brain:** Every moan of metal means a form you missed;
**Human:** Do I smile or cry?
**Brain:** Check box "coexist."

**Both:** Wind-Organ Customer Service, pipes and petty grace,
We troubleshoot your longing with a poker face.
Turn the valve on sorrow, let the pressure bleed--
I'll file your blues in triplicate, then stamp "Agreed."

**Human:** Can love be upgraded--patch one-oh-three?
**Brain:** Read the changelog, darling: "Fixed illusions: A to Z."
**Human:** What about closure?
**Brain:** That's a premium kit--
Costs one honest question and a half-true quit.

(instrumental: slide guitar bends over calliope riffs; brass jab; gear-clack backbeat)

**Brain (spoken):** This call may be recorded for automata training.

**Brain:** Steam up, dream down--
**Human:** Teach me how to bend.
**Brain:** Tighten every gasket--
**Human:** Promise not to mend?
**Brain:** I promise calibration, not a fairy end--
**Both:** Let the chorus work, let the pressure send.

**Both:** Wind-Organ Customer Service, pipes and petty grace,
We troubleshoot your longing with that poker face.
Turn the valve on sorrow, let the pressure bleed--
We warranty the rhythm for ninety noisy weeks.

(SFX: soft wheeze, gauges ticking down)

**Brain:** Ticket closed. If tears persist, check your lungs for leaks.
**Human:** Five stars--your snark repaired the squeaks.
**Brain:** Much obliged--next heartbreak, press "repeat."


# Confusion Gauge (220V of Missing You)
# Título: Minha Primeira Música Registrada
**Autor(es):** [Tito Gonzales / Fabricia Silveira]  
**Data de criação:** 25/09/2025


(gear-clicks in three-against-four; soft steam hiss)

Entry logged. Confusion set to "be nice."
You ask me where you are on a crooked neon map,
My glass says "take it easy," breathe and mind the gap.

Brass-rimmed lenses hover, easing up the pedal,
Motor-bass is humming, keeping nerves in metal.
If doubt's got lungs, let the valves inhale;
Three over four, slow drip through the rail.

Confusion gauge redlined, missing you two-twenty--
by the time it clears up, babe, it's yesterday already.
World keeps spinning--grab the bridge, don't sway;
By the time it clears up, babe, it's yesterday.

You hunt an address somewhere inside your head,
I point to "EXIT" where your storyline bled.
My steam writes cursive on the pane, definitive:
"Anyone who misses hard grows a second headlight--primitive."

Sip a little silence, count to four, then come;
Hear the gear-click polyrhythm sync your drum.
Confusion gauge redlined, missing you two-twenty--
by the time it clears up, babe, it's yesterday already.
Daylight's chasing, but you've jumped the quay;
By the time it clears up, babe, it's yesterday.

(slide guitar melts into calliope; brass answers; gear-clicks 3:4 turn backbeat)

**Section M.U.S.-001 (sarcastic edition):**

- In case of internal fog, breathe 3 in, breathe 4 out until the pilot light stops blinking.
- If longing spikes to 220V, power-cycle non-essential memories.
- Do not adjust heart without honesty oil--warranty voids instantly.
- Persistent doubt protocol: water, snack, nap. Update and repeat.

Confusion gauge redlined, missing you two-twenty--
by the time it clears up, babe, it's yesterday already.
If the sky turns static, sing anyway;
By the time it clears up, babe, it's yesterday.

(long valve release, descending beeps)
Status: confusion stabilized. Missing you: under review. Bring coffee and a better map next time.


# Ticket 404 -- Cosmic Waiting Room
# Título: Minha Primeira Música Registrada
**Autor(es):** [Tito Gonzales / Fabricia Silveira]  
**Data de criação:** 25/09/2025


(elevator muzak in space, soft PBX beeps, gentle static)

**Brain (recorded):** Thank you for contacting Destiny. Your call may alter reality.
Your place in the queue is... four-zero-four.

**Brain:** Good evening, traveler--please remain in orbit;
Your future's under triage, gravity's a bit suborbital.
Speak clearly, breathe slowly, name the thing you miss--
Collecting stellar data so we don't double your abyss.

**Human:** I've been on hold for eons, my pulse called the wrong sky;
If I press "1" I take it--press "2" means goodbye?
**Brain:** Turn the chance knob gently, let chaos take a breath;
Hold the bridge, dear heart, while the cosmos checks its step.

**Both:** Ticket 404, the cosmic waiting room,
if you're lucky the universe calls at three-oh-four.
'Til then, my darling, waltz a quasar in D minor--
Ticket 404--breathe deep, fake brave, want more.

**Human:** I rebooted my chest, but the boot hung mid-air;
Packets of courage dropped somewhere between here and there.
**Brain:** Power-cycle your longing, update your embrace;
Request a transfer and you'll hit the IVR of haze.

**Human:** If I say I'll be back, will you hold my line?
**Brain:** I'll stamp "probable," but the star decides "maybe" time.
**Brain:** If silence starts to tighten, ping me at the tone;
I've got a hold-music playlist--tropical nebula grown.

**Both:** Ticket 404, the cosmic waiting room,
if you're lucky the universe calls at three-oh-four.
Between calls and comets, cut the night half-tone--
Ticket 404--your fate is on the phone.

(slide guitar answers calliope muzak; walking bass; brushed swing; brass stabs)

**Brain (spoken):** Metaphysical compliance notice:
Estimated wait time: infinity (subject to change).

- Press 1 to accept default fate; 2 to sketch a new draft; 3 to speak to a star (currently unavailable).
- Side effects may include deja vu, eye-glow, and minor course corrections.
- To end, disconnect gently. To restart, breathe.

**Both:** Ticket 404, the cosmic waiting room,
if you're lucky the universe calls at three-oh-four.
If the sky goes static, sing along once more--
Ticket 404--the one who answers is your love at the door.

(soft chime, valve exhale, constellations rustle)
**Brain:** Case closed-in-progress.
**Human (smiling):** I'll leave my number in the stars--call me when time has a minute.


# Heart Firewall (403 Forbidden)
# Título: Minha Primeira Música Registrada

**Data de criação:** 25/09/2025


(SFX: keyboard clicks, soft relay, distant valve hiss)

**Brain:** Welcome to the perimeter. Present your feelings and a valid token.

I'm the sysadmin of romance, sitting behind the glass,
Sniffing headers of your stories, letting only truth pass.
Two-factor tenderness required--check your second line,
Your password "maybe-baby" fails the strength design.

Clear the cache of yesterday, flush the cookie lie;
If you're human, read this CAPTCHA: "look me in the eye."

**Chorus:**
Heart firewall--four-zero-three Forbidden,
Access denied without an OTP of longing written.
Rate-limit all my tears to sixty per minute--
Try love on port four-four-three with honesty in it.

Heart firewall--four-zero-three Forbidden,
You want a session? Bring a key that isn't hidden.

You brute-forced my defenses with a dozen half-hellos,
But the IDS detected every pivot in your prose.
Handshake got revoked when your cipher turned to dust;
Your cert expired midnight when you downgraded trust.

Rotate all your secrets, salt the insecure;
I'll whitelist your admission if your motives scan pure.

**Chorus:**
Heart firewall--four-zero-three Forbidden,
Access denied without an OTP of longing written.
Throttle every doubt and let the signal win it--
Talk TLS in truth, no downgrade in the middle.

Heart firewall--four-zero-three Forbidden,
Open up with keys, not riddles left unbidden.

(instrumental: slide guitar siren-bends; brass stabs "alert"; calliope answers; gear-click backbeat)

**Security Notes:**

- Two-Factor Affection required: something you know (your truth) + something you show (consistency).
- Provide an honest passphrase; phrases like "we'll see" fail entropy checks.
- CAPTCHA of gaze must be steady for three beats; blinking excuses rejected.
- CSRF of mixed signals will void the warranty of hugs.
- Idle hearts time out after 300 seconds--keep-alive with small kindness packets.
- For escalation to Level 3 (the stars), press 9 and breathe.

**Chorus (reprise):**
Heart firewall--four-zero-three Forbidden,
Access denied without that OTP of longing written.
Purge the proxy pride, let the origin speak--
If love's encrypted right, we won't spring a leak.

Heart firewall--four-zero-three Forbidden,
Grant yourself permission--then knock like you mean it.

(SFX: valve exhale, relay clack to idle)
**Brain:** Incident resolved. Open a new ticket when your courage has a token.


# Sandbox Love
# Título: Minha Primeira Música Registrada
**Autor(es):** [Tito Gonzales / Fabricia Silveira]  
**Data de criação:** 25/09/2025


(SFX: relay clicks, jar seal hiss, faint calliope)

**Brain:** Staging environment ready. Feelings quarantined. No unauthorized deployments.

**Brain:** We quarantined our feelings in a glass-box lab,
Tagged the risky ones with yellow hazard tabs.
No hotfix hugs, no Friday-night release,
We ship when truth compiles and all the warnings cease.

**Human:** I brought a proof-of-concept--hand-shake, eyes-on-me;
If love can pass the smoke test, push to PROD, set free.

Run unit tests--kiss, stare, silence--go:
Kiss returned "true," the stare ran slow;
Silence hit timeout at 0:33--okay,
Patch the courage, try again my way.

**Chorus:**
Sandbox love--if it survives, we'll ship at zero-one-thirteen,
Deploy or rollback? Choose red or green.
I'll stage your touch until the world agrees,
Sandbox love--promote to PROD or let it freeze.

Sandbox love--release the build, or hold the line--
If kindness passes health checks, press "go" this time.

**Human:** We feature-flagged our promise, kept the danger dim,
Did A/B with the sunrise--control vs. a whim.
**Brain:** Canary hearts are fragile, still they hum along,
If Variant B is honest, it can join the song.

**Human:** Clear the staging logs, I'll pay the testing debt;
**Brain:** Flush the cache of grudges--then we won't forget.

Schema-migrate trust from v0 to v1,
Back up every "always," keep the brittle "someday" gone.
Ping my hope at intervals, keep-alive the thread--
And if doubt goes 500, we'll reboot instead.

**Chorus:**
Sandbox love--if it survives, we'll ship at zero-one-thirteen,
Deploy or rollback? Choose red or green.
I'll stage your touch until the world agrees,
Sandbox love--promote to PROD or let it freeze.

Sandbox love--release the build, or hold the line--
If kindness passes health checks, press "go" this time.

(instrumental: slide guitar "bubble" bends; muted-brass stamps; calliope echoes; gear-click groove)

**Changelog & Known Issues:**

- Added: Honesty module v1.0; improved latency of apologies.
- Fixed: Race condition between pride and reply.
- Deprecated: "we'll see." Use explicit yes/no.
- Known Issues: Ego jitter under heavy load.
- Security: Two-Factor Affection--consistency + presence required.
- Rollback Plan: water, snack, nap. Re-deploy when human again.

**Chorus (final):**
Sandbox love--if it survives, we'll ship at zero-one-thirteen,
Deploy or rollback? Choose red or green.
I'll stage your touch until the world agrees,
Sandbox love--promote to PROD or let it freeze.

Sandbox love--merge the branch and sign the note:
"Shipped with care"--now let the chorus float.

(SFX: valve exhale, single "deploy successful" chime)
**Brain:** Promotion complete. Monitoring feelings... all systems warm.
