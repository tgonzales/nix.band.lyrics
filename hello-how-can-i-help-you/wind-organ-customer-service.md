(SFX: valves open, gentle calliope swell)

**Brain:** Please hold. Your heartbreak is important to us.
**Brain:** Take a number, sweetheart--the breeze is thin;
My wind organ's wheezing from the myths you bring.
**Human:** I need a melody to fix my fate.
**Brain:** We've got a C-minor policy--please hum and wait.

**Brain:** Every moan of metal means a form you missed;
**Human:** Do I smile or cry?
**Brain:** Check box "coexist."

**Both:** Wind-Organ Customer Service, pipes and petty grace,
We troubleshoot your longing with a poker face.
Turn the valve on sorrow, let the pressure bleed--
I'll file your blues in triplicate, then stamp "Agreed."

**Human:** Can love be upgraded--patch one-oh-three?
**Brain:** Read the changelog, darling: "Fixed illusions: A to Z."
**Human:** What about closure?
**Brain:** That's a premium kit--
Costs one honest question and a half-true quit.

(instrumental: slide guitar bends over calliope riffs; brass jab; gear-clack backbeat)

**Brain (spoken):** This call may be recorded for automata training.

**Brain:** Steam up, dream down--
**Human:** Teach me how to bend.
**Brain:** Tighten every gasket--
**Human:** Promise not to mend?
**Brain:** I promise calibration, not a fairy end--
**Both:** Let the chorus work, let the pressure send.

**Both:** Wind-Organ Customer Service, pipes and petty grace,
We troubleshoot your longing with that poker face.
Turn the valve on sorrow, let the pressure bleed--
We warranty the rhythm for ninety noisy weeks.

(SFX: soft wheeze, gauges ticking down)

**Brain:** Ticket closed. If tears persist, check your lungs for leaks.
**Human:** Five stars--your snark repaired the squeaks.
**Brain:** Much obliged--next heartbreak, press "repeat."
