# Insert Coin for Empathy

Hello--how can I help you? Please deposit one doubt.
My pressure reads "Drama High," hear the pistons shout;
Temple doors go whoosh, holy vending light;
Pick your flavored wisdom, no refunds tonight--
I'm kind by mechanism, not enchanted might.

You brought a broken heart? I run on boiling schemes;
I'll patch it with a gasket and distilled daydreams.
Insert coin for empathy--clink! access granted;
Pins and wheels decide the feels my brass has planted.

Ancient idea in a modern role,
Rolling like a cart with a clockwork soul.

Heron wrote the manual, I left snarky notes;
Aeolipile spinning while I roast your quotes.
"Should I text my ex?"--pull the lever, friend:
The oracle prints "NOPE" in copper at the end.

(calliope riff, slide guitar answers)

If you want a shoulder--pipe to your right;
It's warm, it hisses, won't ghost you at night.
Rate my compassion on a five-gear scale--
If it squeaks a little, add oil to the tale.

Insert coin for empathy--clink! hear valves agree;
Customer satisfied? Please rate machinery.
Ancient idea in a modern role,
Rolling through your blues on calibrated soul.

(steam releases, gauges fall)
Thanks for your feelings--please keep the receipt.
