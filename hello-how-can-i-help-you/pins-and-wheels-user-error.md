(SFX: gear-clicks, steam hiss)

Diagnostics complete--congratulations, the problem is you.
I've got a roadmap hammered into brass,
Your "choices" are decals on a foggy glass.

Pre-programmed cart on studs and steel,
You yank the lever left, I keep the factory feel.
Don't blame fate--blame maintenance,
You skipped the grease, here's consequence.

Pins and wheels--user error blues,
You wanted freedom but you tightened all the screws.
You ask for destiny, then override and stall;
I reroute gently--this is mostly your fault.

You love my goggles? They match my tone:
Two circles of judgment, polished chrome.
You brought no spare parts for a miracle start--
I'll lend hex keys for your hopeful heart.

(instrumental: slide guitar bends; gear-clack backbeat; brass jab)

I'm not cold, I'm calibrated--learn the difference, friend;
Feelings are bubbles that pop before the end.
Operator's manual, page ninety-two:
"Oil your expectations. Tighten follow-through."

Pins and wheels--user error blues,
Freedom's a rhythm; keep time or strip the fuse.
You want a new route? Great--install the patch;
Otherwise enjoy this scenic, smoking latch.

Service note: next meltdown due at quarter past truth.
