Hello--ticket validated. Welcome to Dorito City.

My diagnostic reads 87% cognitive drift,
1.2% lucidity index--a charming little rift.
Assigned to quarters with a 4.5 cm sarcasm core,
Glass-lit brain in a jar who can't be ignored.

By my side--a steampunk opossum in a pocketwatch vest,
Tail ticks like seconds while we audit every jest.
Neon maps breathing, rails hum prayers;
The skyline is a circuit of electric flares.

Surface metro to Dorito City, where the sunsets crunch,
Triangles of neon take a byte of my lunch.
Monitored rides, darling, cameras in bloom--
We wave to the drones like flowers in a zoom.

I'll wear my brass goggles, you keep the receipt--
Psychedelic sidewalks under sardonic feet.
Platform oracle whispers, "Mind the gap in your plot,"
Your thoughts are mosaic--mine are soldered hot.

Opossum tips his hat: "Sarcasm on tap,"
We pour two doubles of reality's map.
Billboards grin sideways--corn-chip crown,
The Dorito-faced landlord watches downtown.

(instrumental: slide guitar melts into calliope swirl; brass stabs; tape-echo snare)

The moon turns to a compass, points left inside my head;
Streetcars sprout antlers, the traffic lights shed.
Paint the smoke with laughter, stitch the night in chrome--
Every hiss of the piston spells "you are home."

Surface metro to Dorito City, triangulate the sky,
We ride the rails of irony where satellites spy.
Four-point-five centimeters of barbed lullaby--
Small brain, big mouth, and an ultraviolet eye.

Scan my heart like a ticket--punch line complete;
If wonder feels heavy, let the rhythm take the seat.

(SFX: valve release, metro doors ping)
Next station: Clarity. Please exit through your dream.
