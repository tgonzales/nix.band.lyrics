(SFX: coin drop, steam hiss, neon sign flickers "COME BACK SOON, OK")

Hello--how can I help you? One vibe, no refund.
The queue crawls, number blinks; I'm the glass that sees you, friend,
Brass-rim goggles shining: "state your need, I'll pretend."
You ask for just a vibe--I dispense it, warm and stark,
With midnight aftertaste and boiler-room spark.

My gauge is climbing while your footprints fade;
If longing is a complaint, file it. I'm paid.
Insert a coin, catch the vibe, then run,
Refund denied--house policy, hun.

I act like I don't care, but it's printed on my HUD:
Go with the groove and leave me your mud.
Insert a coin, catch the vibe, then run--
Come back soon, okay? (Sincere. For once.)

You vanish with no backup, leave logs inside my lung,
I mute the siren's wailing, hum the old blues I've sung.
I stamp "almost forever" on your wrinkled little slip,
And add a PS: "Your exit was a pre-programmed trip."

If it's love, speak valve; if doubt, speak brass--
I'll translate to a loop your heart can pass.
Insert a coin, catch the vibe, then run,
Refund denied--policy's one-to-one.

I play the professional, but the glass won't lie:
Between hiss and groove, your absence walks by.
Insert a coin, catch the vibe, then run--
Come back soon, okay? (See the sign burn on.)

(instrumental: slide guitar answers calliope; brass jabs; gear-clack backbeat)

Brain: Ticket open: item "unexpected longing."
Human: Can we split the charges into rhythm and belonging?
Brain: Coin-op plan: one touch, one hiss, one "hi."
Human: And if I ghost again?
Brain: I stamp "later." Nice try.

Insert a coin, catch the vibe, then run,
Refund denied--last notice, done.
Leave your echo trapped in my amber glass;
I'll reamp it in blues when the night won't pass.

Insert a coin, catch the vibe, then run--
Come back soon, okay? (I won't even charge a ton.)

"Client absent, longing present." Case closed--until you return.
